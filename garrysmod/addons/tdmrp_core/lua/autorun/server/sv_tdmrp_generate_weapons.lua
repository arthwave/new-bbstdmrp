-- TDMRP Weapon Generator (Reference Only)

-- The actual weapon files are pre-generated and live in:
--   lua/weapons/tdmrp_m9k_*/shared.lua
--
-- This file is kept as documentation of the generation process.
-- If you need to regenerate weapons, use the VS Code tooling.
----------------------------------------------------

-- This file does nothing at runtime - weapons are pre-generated
